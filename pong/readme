getting started
- install latest node.js (i installed version 14)
- npm install #this installs all the dependencies
- npm start #this runs the server
- open localhost:3000 in chrome (seems to have better performance than firefox)
- emulate the headset in your browser: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webvr-api-emulation/gbdnpaebafagioggnhkacnaaahpiefil?hl=en
- use https://ngrok.com/ to expose your local node server to the internet so you can access it on your oculus
